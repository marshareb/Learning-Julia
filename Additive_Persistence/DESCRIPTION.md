Inspired by this tweet, today's challenge is to calculate the additive persistence of a number, defined as how many loops you have to do summing its digits until you get a single digit number. Take an integer N:

(1)    Add its digits

(2)    Repeat until the result has 1 digit

The total number of iterations is the additive persistence of N.

Your challenge today is to implement a function that calculates the additive persistence of a number.
